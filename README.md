# lets-travel

A site where posts of travel landmarks and a description are shown to viewers. Clicking on more details brings up a larger
picture of the landmark, date the post was added, and an interative map of the location of the landmark!

*Utilized:
  -MongoDB as database for posts, call-back requests, mail, and users

 -Node.js, node package manager (npm), and various packages:
    -express (framework includes redirecting requests from one file to another via Router)
    -uniqid (unique id per post)
    -middleware (used to encrypt passwords and security authorization to allow certain functionality for only authorized users, 
     like deleting posts)
    
 -HTML, JS, CSS
 
 -Bootstrap (for formatting, forms, styling)
 
 - Visual Studio Code for choice of environment
